# Project Deep Dive: TeacherZero - AI Assistance, Teacher Control


## The Problem: The Teacher Time Sink

Educators consistently lose precious hours to the repetitive, time-consuming task of creating worksheets and prep materials. Existing digital tools are often clunky, generic, or force teachers into becoming prompt engineers, diverting focus from actual teaching. The goal was to leverage AI to genuinely reduce this burden without sacrificing pedagogical control.

## My Solution: TeacherZero - An Intuitive AI Co-Pilot

TeacherZero is designed as AI TA, not a replacement. Like some other similar products, it uses Large Language Models to accelerate worksheet creation, but what makes it unique is its interface. The user operates through an **intuitive, menu-driven interface** that translates teacher intent directly into AI Agent actions. The core philosophy is **"Human in Control,"** empowering educators with AI speed while retaining their expertise and oversight.

### 1. The "No Prompts" Interface: Translating Intent to Action

The central challenge was enabling powerful AI interaction without requiring teachers to write complex prompts. TeacherZero achieves this through:

*   **Structured Inputs:** Teachers initiate worksheet generation either by uploading existing lesson materials (PDFs, PowerPoints, even YouTube videos) or specifying a topic in a text prompt (e.g., "Roman Empire"). 
*   ** Selecting desired question types:** Pick between: Multiple Choice, Short Answer, Essay, Matching, T/F and Fill-in-the-blank, and define the number of each question type via clear **menu options and buttons** (not a text prompt!).

> **Design Insight:** By abstracting prompt engineering into intuitive UI elements, the system allows teachers to leverage complex AI capabilities using familiar interactions, significantly lowering the barrier to adoption and use.

### 2. The Enhancement Engine: Rapid Iteration While Keeping Quality

Once an initial draft is generated, teachers use the "Enhancement Engine" – a set of clear buttons – to refine the content:

*   **Targeted Edits:** Buttons like "Harder," "Easier," "Different Topic," "Rephrase" trigger specific prompt templates targeting individual questions.
*   **Context Injection:** These templates dynamically pull in relevant context, such as the original source material (if uploaded), the specific question being edited, and the content of the rest of the worksheet, ensuring coherence.

*   **AI Model Choice (Gemini 2.5 Flash):** Early experiments with more powerful but slower models (using self-critique and iterative improvement loops) proved inefficient. They took too long and didn't necessarily produce better results, as teacher oversight is crucial.
*   **Focus on Iteration:** Flash's speed enables rapid cycles of AI generation and Human refinement. The vision pivoted from "AI generates worksheets" to **"AI generates 80% quickly, teacher refines the final 20% efficiently."** This gives the teacher's expertise the primacy it deserves.

*   **Seamless Workflow:** The interface prioritizes speed. For instance, while buttons provide structure, typing as soon as the Enhancement Engine is opened directly initiates text-based refinement, minimizing clicks.

> **Technical Insight:** Prioritizing AI speed over theoretical perfection of slower models was a key pivot based on usability testing and the understanding that teacher-led iteration is faster and more effective for creating high-quality educational materials.

### 3. AI-Powered Image Search (Vector Database)

To further enhance worksheets, TeacherZero incorporates an intelligent image search feature:

*   **Upload & AI Description:** Users can upload their own images. Upon upload, an AI model generates a description, which is stored alongside the image.
*   **Vector Database:** These AI-generated descriptions are converted into vector embeddings and stored in a Postgres database.
*   **Semantic Search:** When a teacher searches for an image (e.g., "Water Cycle"), their query is vectorized, and a semantic search finds the top 5 images with the most similar description vectors in the database.
*   **Future Enhancement:** In the future, I plan to integrate web image search if the internal database yields poor results, using a visual AI to search for an appropriate image, taking into account the question context.

> **Technical Insight:** Leverages vector embeddings and semantic search to provide a more relevant image search experience than simple keyword matching, drawing on AI-generated descriptions for richer context.

### 4. Addressing Limitations & Pedagogical Soundness

*   **Teacher Control:** Pedagogical soundness isn't enforced by the AI attempting to be perfect, but by ensuring the **teacher is always the final editor and approver.** The AI assists, suggests, and automates, but doesn't dictate.
*   **Non-STEM Focus (Current Limitation):** The current focus on non-STEM subjects is primarily due to challenges in reliably rendering mathematical formulas with the current tech stack, not an intentional exclusion. Support for formula-heavy subjects is a target for future development, and a necessity before this product goes to market.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

*   **Frontend:** Electron Application built with React & TypeScript. A web app might have been a better choice, future migration is considered.
*   **Core AI:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via API).
*   **Backend Logic:** **Cloudflare Workers** for backend API processing and key management.
*   **Image Database & Search:** Supabase (storing images and vector embeddings).

## Challenges & Learnings

*   **Pivoting on AI Strategy:** The key realization was understanding that maximizing speed for rapid iteration is more valuable than pursuing slower, complex self-correction.
*   **UI Abstraction:** Designing intuitive UI controls that effectively map to complex prompt engineering requirements was a significant challenge, requiring constant refinement.

## Current Status & Next Steps

TeacherZero is a functional **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** demonstrating the core value proposition.

*   **Validation:** Early demos have confirmed significant teacher interest in the time savings.
*   **Near-Term:** Port to webapp framework, implement user authentication, implement support for math formulas, and prepare for targeted beta testing.
*   **Future Plans:** Enhance image search and start building TeacherOne: AI assisted worksheet grading.
