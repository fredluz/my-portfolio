# Project Brief: Portfolio Template Analysis & Customization

## 1. Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a portfolio website template obtained from GitHub. The primary goal is to understand its structure, functionality, and customization options.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   **Analyze the template:** Understand the technology stack, file structure, component organization, and data flow.
*   **Identify customization points:** Determine how to modify content (text, images), styling (colors, fonts), and potentially layout.
*   **Document findings:** Record the analysis and customization steps in the Memory Bank.
*   **Provide guidance:** Explain how the template works and how the user can make specific modifications (e.g., changing text color).

## 3. Goals

*   Enable the user to confidently customize the portfolio template to their needs.
*   Establish a clear understanding of the template's architecture for future modifications.
*   Create comprehensive documentation within the Memory Bank.

## 4. Scope

*   **In Scope:** Analysis of the existing template code, identification of configuration files and key components, explanation of customization methods, guidance on specific styling changes (like text color).
*   **Out of Scope:** Major feature additions, complete redesigns, deployment setup (unless specifically requested later).

## 5. Key Stakeholders

*   The user (owner of the portfolio).
*   Cline (assisting with analysis and customization).
