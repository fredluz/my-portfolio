# Current Task: TeacherZero Landing Page Integration

## Objective

Integrate the TeacherZero product landing page into the existing portfolio website.

## Requirements

1.  **Fix 404 Error:** Resolve the issue where accessing `/teacherZero` renders the application's custom 404 page (`not-found.tsx`) despite the route existing and returning a 200 status code.
2.  **Set URL:** Ensure the landing page is accessible specifically at the URL `http://localhost:3000/teacherZero` (with an uppercase 'Z').

## Current Status

*   The necessary page components (`src/app/teacherZero/page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `page.module.scss`) exist.
*   The directory was renamed to `src/app/teacherZero`.
*   Initial build errors after renaming were resolved by clearing the `.next` cache.
*   The server returns 200 OK for `/teacherZero`, but renders the custom `not-found.tsx` page.
*   Analysis revealed the `src/components/RouteGuard.tsx` component was blocking the route because `/teacherZero` was not listed in the `routes` object in `src/app/resources/config.js`.
*   **Fix Applied:** Added `"/teacherZero": true` to the `routes` object in `src/app/resources/config.js`.

## Next Steps (Verification)

1.  Verify if the TeacherZero landing page now renders correctly at `http://localhost:3000/teacherZero`.
2.  Update `activeContext.md`.
3.  If successful, conclude the task. If not, further investigation is needed.
